## Hi hi, I'm Great ðŸ‘‹ 
Iâ€™m a Computer Science student with a strong interest in technology and problem-solving. My background in design gives me an eye for detail, and Iâ€™m now building on that by developing skills in programming and software development.  

On this profile, youâ€™ll find projects that reflect my journey â€” from small experiments to more structured applications as I grow.  

### Areas Iâ€™m exploring
- Programming (Python, JavaScript, web technologies)  
- Smart contracts and Web3 (Solidity, blockchain applications)  
- Clean, user-friendly design and interfaces
