## Hi hi, I'm Great 👋 

<!--I’m a Computer Science student with a strong interest in technology and problem-solving. My background in design gives me an eye for detail, and I’m now building on that by developing skills in programming and software development.  

On this profile, you’ll find projects that reflect my journey — from small experiments to more structured applications as I grow.  

### Areas I’m exploring
- Programming (Python, JavaScript, web technologies)  
- Smart contracts and Web3 (Solidity, blockchain applications)  
- Clean, user-friendly design and interfaces  

### Outside tech
I enjoy movies, anime, and keeping up with the latest in science and technology.
